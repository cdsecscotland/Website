Cyber Security is one of many sectors that is being rapidly transformed by artificial intelligence (AI). By enabling real-time threat identification and response and enhancing security operations, AI has the potential to improve Cyber Security.

How can AI improve Cyber Security?

AI's fast analysis of massive amounts of data is one of the technology's key advantages. Network traffic can be analysed by AI-powered security systems to find anomalies that might point to a potential cyber-attack.Â 

AI can also be used to automate security procedures, such as patch management and vulnerability scanning, lightening the load on security staff.

However, thieves can also utilise AI to create complex attacks. For instance, AI-powered phishing attacks can be customised to a person's behaviour and interests, which makes them harder to spot. AI can be used to create malware that can avoid detection by conventional antivirus programmes.

To avoid AI threats, experts must employ specific AI-powered security solutions to battle these threats and keep up with cybercriminals. In order to prevent AI from being used maliciously, regulations must be established and AI must be used responsibly.

By strengthening threat detection and response and enhancing security operations, AI has the potential to revolutionise Cyber Security. However, if cyber criminals employ it, it also poses a serious threat. Therefore, experts need to keep up with the most recent AI developments and strategically implement them while keeping ethical considerations in mind.
