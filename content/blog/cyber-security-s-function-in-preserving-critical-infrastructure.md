The systems, facilities, and networks that are crucial to the operation of society and the economy are referred to as critical infrastructure. Power grids, transportation networks, water treatment facilities, and communication networks are all examples of this.

More and more these systems are becoming reliant on digital technology, which leaves them open to hacker attacks. Numerous instances of cyber attacks on vital infrastructure have occurred in recent years, underscoring the necessity for effective Cyber Security measures.

How does cyber security protect critical infrastructure? 

Cyber Security plays a variety of roles in safeguarding vital infrastructure. Firstly, it involves making sure that it is taken into consideration when designing and constructing the infrastructure.Â 

This means that security should not be an afterthought but rather an essential component of design. In order to keep the infrastructure resilient to changing cyber threats, it should also be periodically tested and upgraded.

Secondly, successful risk management is necessary in critical infrastructure. Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, evaluating their impact and likelihood, and putting in place the necessary controls to lessen them are all part of this process. Risk management should be a continual process, with regular evaluations and updates to take into account changes in the threat landscape.

Thirdly, efficient incident response planning is necessary for Cyber Security in critical infrastructure. This entails creating and testing response strategies for a variety of conceivable events, from minor mishaps to extensive cyber attacks. Clear roles and duties, escalation procedures, and communication protocols should all be part of response plans.

Cyber Security should be recognised for the critical role it plays in safeguarding critical infrastructure, protecting our society and economy as a result. It necessitates a holistic strategy that includes risk management that is effective, incident response planning that is comprehensive and infrastructure that is designed and built with Cyber Security in mind.
