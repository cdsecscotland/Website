In today’s digital world, cyber-attacks have become increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, posing a significant threat to businesses of all sizes. Cybercriminals are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities they can exploit, making it crucial for businesses to take a proactive approach to cyber security. One of the most effective ways to do so is through internal penetration testing.

Penetration testing involves simulating a cyber-attack on a business’s network to identify and exploit any vulnerabilities that exist. This is done to evaluate the security of a company’s infrastructure and assess its readiness to defend against cyber-attacks. While vulnerability scanning is often used as a quick and easy way to check for vulnerabilities, it is inferior to internal penetration testing.

Vulnerability scanning involves scanning a network for known vulnerabilities and producing a report of the findings. However, it is limited to identifying only known vulnerabilities and cannot detect unknown vulnerabilities or other security issues that are not related to vulnerabilities. Internal penetration testing, on the other hand, is much more comprehensive and can identify unknown vulnerabilities, as well as provide a realistic view of the potential damage an attacker could inflict.

In addition, internal testing can be tailored to the specific needs and risks of a business. This allows for a more in-depth evaluation of the security of a company’s infrastructure, as well as a better understanding of the potential threats facing the business. Internal penetration testing can be conducted using a variety of methods, including black-box testing, gray-box testing, and white-box testing, which allows for a more targeted approach to the testing.

Overall, while vulnerability scanning may be a quick and easy way to identify known vulnerabilities, it is no match for the comprehensive evaluation that internal penetration testing can provide. With the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, businesses cannot afford to take a chance with their cyber security. Internal penetration testing is the most effective way to assess the security of a company’s infrastructure and ensure that it is prepared to defend against cyber-attacks.
