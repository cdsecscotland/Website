With the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly advanced the healthcare sector. To maintain patient safety and privacy, it is necessary to address the new security threats and problems that have been brought about by medical equipment.

What is IoMT?

Similarly to IoT, IoMT is a network of devices, sensors and other equipment that are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other. The only difference is that these are healthcare related devices and equipment. This technology can be used to monitor patients remotely, track their vital signs, and collect data on their health conditions

What issues could arise from IoMT?

The vulnerability of IoMT devices to cyber attacks is one of the main issues. If a hacker gains access to these devices, they may be able to alter patient information or even take over the apparatus, which could result in injury or even death. Healthcare providers and device makers must give Cyber Security first priority when designing and implementing IoMT devices in order to reduce these risks.

Implementing strong authentication and access controls for IoMT devices, such as multi-factor authentication and role-based access restrictions, is one important method. Additionally, to address any known defects or vulnerabilities in the devices' software, routine software upgrades and patching must be carried out. In order to respond swiftly and efficiently to any possible Cyber Security problems, healthcare providers must create incident response strategies.

The privacy of the data is another crucial factor. It is essential that appropriate data encryption and access controls are in place to stop unauthorised access to or publication of this information given the enormous volumes of sensitive patient data generated by IoMT devices. In compliance with data protection laws, patient agreement is also required before any data is collected or used.

While we can recognize that IoMT devices in healthcare have many advantages, to protect patient safety and wellbeing, it is crucial to give Cyber Security and privacy first priority.
