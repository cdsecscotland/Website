As technology advances, many aspects of our lives have been revolutionised.  With this development, the complexity of handling cyber security has also increased. As our lives become more and more digital, the opportunity for attack increases. In our latest blog post, we’ll explain how technology advances have created new hazards in cyber security. 

Advancements in technologies

Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)  are just two examples of the new technologies that have become widely used due to innovation. Although these improvements have advantages, they also create new weaknesses that fraudsters often exploit, calling for more sophisticated security solutions.

Effects of cloud solutions on cyber security

To ensure operational flexibility and robustness, businesses increasingly rely on multi-cloud solutions, often using services from several suppliers. Although this has its benefits, this strategy makes cyber security management much more complex as it requires the supervision of numerous interfaces and governance models.

You can find out more about the importance of cloud security in our helpful explainer. 

Shadow IT

The practice of employees routinely using unauthorised hardware and software for work-related tasks is called "shadow IT." This makes it more challenging to maintain a safe environment as it adds numerous unknown variables to the mix.

Insider threats on cyber security 

As the workforce becomes increasingly decentralised, insider risks have become more serious. With remote work growing more common, everyone from freelancers to full-time workers working from home could fit the "insider threat" profile, which complicates security management.

Check out our tips for keeping remote workers cyber secure.

Regulatory complexity

GDPR in the European Union is one example of a data protection law that imposes strict guidelines on how data must be treated. However, as cyber threats change, so do these rules, necessitating ongoing cyber security procedure updates from enterprises to maintain compliance.

AI threats on cyber security

If you have access to artificial intelligence tools, chances are hackers do too. Cyber security is becoming a moving target as thieves increasingly use it to create more advanced and adaptive malware.

The rate of technological development and the constantly changing nature of threats both contribute to the growing complexity of managing cyber security. The need for dynamic, all-encompassing cyber security solutions is becoming increasingly critical as we enter a digital focused future. It takes continuing education, persistent monitoring, and the capacity for adaptation to maintain security in this complicated environment.
