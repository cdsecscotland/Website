Since the advent of facial recognition software, fingerprint scanners, and other biometric features, biometric authentication has grown in popularity as a means of security. 

Although password-based security still has some advantages, there are also some drawbacks and potential threats to take into account.

Benefits of biometric authentication

The fact that biometric authentication offers a more secure form of identification than conventional passwords is one of its key advantages. Biometric IDs are specific to each person and challenging to duplicate, unlike passwords, which are frequently forgotten or compromised.

Convenience is another bonus. Long gone are the days of memorising complicated passwords to gain access to your devices, biometric authentication allows for a swift and simple unlock.

Issues that can arise from biometric authentication

Despite this, it has its drawbacks. For instance, using biometric features can occasionally be challenging. This is especially the case for people with certain physical limitations or disabilities. 

Not to mention, if biometric data is not stored securely, it may be open to theft or misuse.

The use of this type of authentication may also have some hazards. For example, if a hacker has access to a user's biometric information, they could use it to assume the user's identity and access secure systems or confidential data. Concerns exist around the possibility of governments or businesses using biometric data improperly.

It's crucial to make sure that biometric data is properly maintained and well-encrypted in order to reduce these threats. Furthermore, it's crucial to be aware of its limitations and employ extra security measures, such as password protection or two-factor authentication, when necessary.

The most important takeaway from all this is, that even if password-based security still has numerous advantages over biometric authentication, it's crucial to be aware of the restrictions and dangers this technology may pose. 

We can continue to benefit from the convenience and security that biometric authentication provides by being aware of these threats and taking precautions to safeguard our biometric data.
