Principles

Inclusivity in Security: Don't limit security to the IT department; instead, make it a shared duty at all organisational levels.

Proactive Defence: Use early detection techniques and ongoing monitoring to stay ahead of potential threats.

Integrated Approach: Include cyber security in every aspect of the day-to-day activities of the business.

Practices

Initial Training: Orient new hires to the organisation by stressing the value of cybersecurity best practices.

Ongoing Education: Hold frequent training sessions to keep the staff informed about the most recent security procedures and dangers.

Effectiveness: Test the organisation's reaction to security breaches by using simulated cyberattacks.

Policy Accessibility: Ensure that all security policies are always readily available to staff members.

Resources

Establish an internal repository with simple-to-follow incident response protocols, best practices, and cyber security guidelines.

Tracking and Adapting

Review and modify security procedures and policies on a regular basis in response to employee input and changes in the cybersecurity threat landscape.
