The digital environment is dynamic and constantly changing. As it does, the various cyber threats organisations face  also change. The year 2023 has seen several advancements in cyber attacks that demand our attention. Here are a few of the notable new techniques.

Main cyber threats of 2023

Deepfake extortion

Deepfake technology has been applied in a noticeably sneakier way lately. Criminals now produce deepfake videos of executives discussing critical topics. To stop the public distribution of the footage, a ransom is requested.

Quantum risks

A drawback of the development of quantum computing could be its ability to defeat previously impenetrable encryption schemes. It's not a common problem but a growing concern that needs attention.

Advanced social engineering

The technological advancement of social engineering has improved its effectiveness. Chatbots are using artificial intelligence to trick employees into disclosing secure information. These bots are incredibly convincing, thanks to the development of this technology. 

IoT

Devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) have emerged as a new entry point for hackers. These ostensibly harmless gadgets can act as entry points into more secure systems, emphasising the significance of security even in less evident network components.

Self-adapting malware

Malware that can adapt independently has emerged due to attackers using automated machine learning (AutoML). Défense strategies become more challenging due to the malware's rapid understanding of new security standards.

Data integrity attacks

Data poisoning, a strategy to tamper with the data sets used by machine learning models, is becoming more popular. This poses a small but significant risk by potentially skewing computational conclusions.

In 2023, the nature of cyber threats will change, necessitating an equally flexible response. The digital era offers numerous advantages, but it also presents new difficulties. A secure digital environment must be maintained by remaining informed and vigilant.
