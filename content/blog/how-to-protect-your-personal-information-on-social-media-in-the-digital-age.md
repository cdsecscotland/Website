Social networking has become a crucial aspect of our daily life in the digital age. Social media sites are an excellent way to remain in touch with friends and family and share insights into our lives. However, they also carry a big risk to our online privacy, with some sites gathering a ton of personal data about us that can be used for identity theft or targeted advertising. 

To help you navigate social media safely, we’ve shared our top four pieces of advice for keeping your personal data safe.

How to keep your data safe on social media

1. Be cautious about the information you share online

Consider your actions carefully before disclosing personal information like your address, phone number, or birth date. When strangers or organisations ask you for personal information, be suspicious.

2. Review your social media privacy settings

The default privacy settings on many social media networks may expose more information than you are comfortable with. To make sure you are only sharing information with the people you want to, remember to check and modify your privacy settings to how you see fit.

3. Be careful with online apps and services

Your personal information is necessary for many apps and services to operate. A good rule of thumb is to only utilise trustworthy and essential apps and services and to carefully consider the permissions you are giving them.

4. Be on the lookout for phishing and scam attempts on social networking sites. 

Social media is frequently used by scammers to lure victims into disclosing personal information or clicking on nefarious links. Always check the sender's identification before responding to friend requests or other unwanted messages and be careful of them.

Exercising caution, being mindful and being aware are all necessary for protecting your personal information in the social media age. By taking on these suggestions, you can take use of social media's advantages while reducing the threats to your online privacy.
