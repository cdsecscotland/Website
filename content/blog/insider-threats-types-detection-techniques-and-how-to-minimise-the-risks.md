Insider threats refer to the risks posed by individuals who have authorised access to an organisation's systems and data. While external threats are often the focus of cybersecurity efforts, insider threats can be just as dangerous and potentially devastating.

What are insider threats?

There are several types of insider threats, including unintentional, negligent, and malicious. Unintentional threats arise from employees who make mistakes or accidentally compromise security, such as misplacing devices or clicking on suspicious links. Negligent threats stem from employees who fail to follow security protocols, either because they do not understand them or because they feel they are too restrictive. Malicious threats come from individuals who deliberately set out to harm the organisation, whether it is for financial gain or other reasons.

Detecting these threats can be challenging, as these individuals often have authorised access to the systems they are attempting to exploit. However, there are several techniques that can help identify potential insider threats, such as monitoring employee activity and using behavioural analysis. This involves looking for anomalies in an employee's behaviour, such as attempting to access files or systems outside their normal scope of work or logging in at unusual times.

To minimise the risks posed, organisations should implement policies and procedures that restrict access to sensitive data and systems. This includes using least privilege access controls, where employees are only given the access they need to perform their jobs. It is also essential to train employees on cybersecurity best practices, including how to identify potential threats and how to report them. Additionally, organisations should conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify areas of vulnerability and take appropriate action to address them.

In conclusion, insider threats pose a significant risk to organisations, and it is crucial to take proactive measures to prevent them. This includes implementing robust security protocols, monitoring employee activity, and providing regular training to employees. By being vigilant and proactive, organisations can minimise the risks posed by insider threats and protect their valuable data and systems.
