Small businesses nowadays are more and more dependent on technology to run and store sensitive data. However, their reliance on technology leaves them open to online dangers like ransomware, spyware, and phishing attempts. Cyber attacks and threats can not only cost an organisation financially but can also negatively affect its reputation.

How to protect a small business from cyber security threats

In order to protect themselves from cyber security threats, it is important that small firms implement best practices. These practices can include routine software updates, multi-factor authentication and frequent employee Cyber Security awareness training in order to protect themselves from cyber threats.

Investing in security tools is also recommended for keeping cyber threats at bay. Systems such as intrusion detection systems, antivirus software and firewalls are all beneficial in protecting a small business.

How to prevent phishing attacks

As a small organisation, protecting your emails from becoming the victim of phishing attacks is another step you must take. A phishing scam is a type of cyber attack where criminals use false emails to coerce employees into disclosing important information or downloading dangerous software. To prevent this, it is vitally important to adopt email security tools as well as to train staff on how to spot a phishing email. Businesses should also set up rules that demand the verification of any email that requests sensitive information in order to prevent phishing attempts.

How to prevent ransomware attacks

Ransomware attacks occur when fraudsters employ software to encrypt data and demand payment for its decryption. These are another serious concern for small firms. 

To prevent ransomware attacks, first and foremost all important data should regularly be backed up. You should also ensure that all software is up to date, using antivirus softwares that can both find and block malware to prevent ransomware attacks. 

To best protect your firm from threats such as these, it is imperative that cyber security practices are prioritised. Small firms can lower their chance of falling victim to a cyber-attack by investing in Cyber Security solutions and educating staff members about Cyber Security.
