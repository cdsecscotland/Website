Closed Door Security Exhibits at CYBERUK 2023: A breakdown of the event

Last week Closed Door Security headed off to Belfast to attend and exhibit at CYBERUK 2023. The event took place at Belfast’s ICC and hosted over 2,000 industry professionals to discuss some of the most recent and challenging Cyber Security topics under one roof. 

Hosted by the UK Government’s National Cyber Security Centre, CYBERUK 2023 welcomed nearly 100 exhibitors ranging from SMEs, government bodies and some of the UKs biggest names in Cyber Security.

What was discussed at CYBERUK 2023?

Day 1 kicked off with a welcome address from Lindy Cameron (CEO, NCSC) and a panel discussion chaired by Cameron. The discussion explored the future actions needed to secure a “resilient and prosperous” tomorrow. The panel brought to light how and where different nations and institutions should collaborate to achieve a stronger cyber security posture.

Our highlights include a workshop exploring the role of the National Cyber Force (NCF) as part of the UK’s growing cyber ecosystem, a talk exploring the future of Cyber Security in the supply chain and a technical masterclass on threat modelling.

Day 2 explored key issues even further and our team particularly enjoyed the technical masterclass on red teaming and the panel discussion titled, ‘We have the technology. Why aren't we using it? Let's commit to fixing our foundations’.

Closed Door Security’s Key Takeaways from CYBERUK 2023

We must work harder and more collaboratively to achieve greater resiliency and security in the UK. CYBERUK 2023 taught us the value of key people in our industry coming together to address problems in an open and critical environment.

As cyber threats are on the rise, our cyber communities need to push for more innovation and skills development across our industry to ensure a safer future for our organisations.

Discussions surrounding ransomware, international conflicts and an increase in phishing attempts highlighted that both private and public sector bodies need to pay more attention to cyber treats and have cyber security are the forefront of their organisational strategy.
