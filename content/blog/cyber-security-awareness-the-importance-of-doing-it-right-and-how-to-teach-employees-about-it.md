Cyber Security awareness is more important than ever as cyber attacks become more frequent and sophisticated. Every person and organisation in the modern digital age is accountable for making sure that their online activities and data are secure.

Top tips for cyber security awareness:

Understanding the risks and hazards that exist in the digital sphere and taking the necessary precautions to avoid or respond to them constitute Cyber Security awareness. 

This entails keeping up with the most recent security risks, putting strong passwords and access limits in place and routinely backing up crucial data. Additionally, it entails exercising caution and vigilance before opening emails, clicking links, or downloading attachments from unreliable or dubious sources.

Additionally, employers are essential in raising employee understanding of Cyber Security issues. This entails regularly educating people on Cyber Security best practices, such as how to spot and react to phishing scams and other social engineering techniques. 

Additionally, it entails defining precise guidelines and rules for access control and data protection, as well as constantly monitoring and updating these guidelines as necessary.

Employers can also use technical solutions to improve the security of their networks and data, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption. The security posture of an organisation can also be identified and strengthened with the use of regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

In today's digital environment, Cyber Security awareness is crucial, and everyone has a responsibility to protect their online actions and data.
