Social engineering is a method of manipulating individuals to divulge sensitive information or perform actions that may harm an organisation. These attacks are often used to gain access to confidential information. This information can include passwords, bank account details, and personal identification information. The attacks may be carried out through various mediums such as email, phone calls, and social media. In this post, we will explore the different types of social engineering attacks, provide examples, and discuss prevention techniques.

Types of Social Engineering Attacks

There are several types of social engineering attacks that cybercriminals use to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or taking specific actions. Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks include:

Phishing: Phishing is an attack where cybercriminals send fraudulent emails that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or an e-commerce website. The emails will often contain a link that, when clicked, takes the user to a fake website designed to steal login credentials or personal information.

Pretexting: Pretexting is an attack where cybercriminals create a false identity and use it to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information. For example, an attacker may pose as a bank employee and call an individual to obtain their account details.

Baiting: Baiting is an attack where cybercriminals offer a tempting reward or gift, such as a free movie download, in exchange for personal information. The victim is often required to provide their personal details or download malicious software in order to receive the reward.

Scareware: Scareware is an attack where cybercriminals use fear to manipulate individuals into taking action, such as downloading fake antivirus software. The victim is often led to believe that their computer is infected with a virus and that the only way to fix the problem is to download the software.

Examples of Social Engineering Attacks

One example of a significant social engineering attack was the 2015 TalkTalk data breach. In this attack, hackers were able to obtain personal and financial information from over 157,000 customers of the telecommunications company TalkTalk.

The attack was carried out through a sophisticated social engineering scheme, in which the hackers posed as TalkTalk employees and convinced employees of the company's Indian call centres to hand over access to customer data. The hackers used this data to steal money from customers and commit identity theft.

The attack had a significant impact on TalkTalk's reputation and financial standing, with the company losing over 100,000 customers and experiencing a drop in stock prices. In 2016, several individuals were arrested and charged in connection with the attack."

Another example is the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which was spread through a phishing email. The email contained a link to a fake invoice, and when the victim clicked on the link, the malware was downloaded onto their computer.

Social engineering prevention techniques

Preventing social engineering attacks requires a combination of technical controls and employee education. Some of the prevention techniques that organisations can use include:

Employee training: Organisations should provide regular training to employees on how to identify and respond to social engineering attacks.

Multifactor authentication: Organisations should implement multifactor authentication to ensure that attackers cannot gain access to accounts with stolen credentials.

Strong passwords: Employees should be required to use strong, unique passwords that are changed regularly.

Encryption: Sensitive data should be encrypted to prevent unauthorised access in case of a breach.

Antivirus software: Organisations should install and regularly update antivirus software to protect against malware.

Overall, social engineering attacks are a significant threat to organisations and individuals alike. These attacks can be carried out through various methods, including phishing, pretexting, baiting, and scareware. To prevent these attacks, organisations should implement a combination of technical controls and employee education. With the proper prevention techniques in place, organisations can minimise the risk of falling victim to social engineering attacks and protect sensitive information.
