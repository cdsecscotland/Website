As cyber threats continue to escalate, there is an increased demand for cyber security specialists within the industry, surpassing the available supply and leading to a significant skills gap.

How to cope with a cyber security talent shortage

Upskill present employees: Provide frequent training to improve the cyber security abilities of your present personnel.

Implement Automation: Use automated tools and artificial intelligence (AI) to handle regular security activities, reducing the stress on specialists.

Create a Cyber-Aware Culture: Instill cyber security awareness in all employees to lessen the need for professionals to perform basic security practices.

Collaborate with educational institutions to establish curricula that are aligned with industry demands and to give internships to groom future talent.

Consider Outsourcing: To fill immediate shortfalls in expertise, outsource certain cyber security responsibilities to external companies.

Diversify recruiting practices: Investigate remote recruiting possibilities and explore applicants from diverse origins with transferable abilities.

Overall, to address the cyber security talent gap, a combination of internal training, technological adoption, and creative hiring practices is required. Organisations can also reduce the impact of the global skills gap by including a wider talent pool and using advanced technology.
